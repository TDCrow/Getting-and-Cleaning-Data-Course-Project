The tidy data displays the means of a subset of measurements (mean/standard devation measurements specifically) from accelerometer data from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone for each of thirty volunteer subjects doing one of six actions. It is a 180x6 table. 

##The tidy datset generated contains the following variables
-Subjects - the thirty people in the data study referenced to by the numbers 1 to 30.
-Activity - the six activities the people in the study were undertaking: Laying, Sitting, Standing, Walking, Walking Downstairs, Walking Upstairs
-"Mean of" Variables - this displays the means of a subset of the data collected by the accelerometers on each subject under a different activity. THe subset of data is, more specifically, only the data from the acceleromters that described the means or standard deviations for each measurement. There are 66 such "mean of" Variables.
